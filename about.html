                    <p>
                        At first glance, a cleaning service seems like an incredibly easy and low-cost business to
                        start: How hard can it be to find someone who's willing to pay you to take care of household
                        chores? <br> There's no question that the market
                        for home cleaning is huge, but the challenge lies in making yourself stand out as a
                        high-quality, trustworthy service provider. <br> "People think you just need a bucket and mop to
                        get started, but that's not really true." You're
                        not in the cleaning business; you're in the customer-service business. People have different
                        ideas of what cleanliness is, and if you're not interested in always making the customer happy,
                        this is not the industry for you." <br> If you're thinking of launching your own cleaning
                        service, here are a few things you need to do.

                    <div class="we-do">
                        <div><h2>Basic House Cleaning:</h2> A service that involves general house cleaning jobs. You’ll attend to
                            areas like the kitchen, lounge, bathroom, and bedroom. Tasks include mopping, vacuuming,
                            dusting, polishing, sweeping. For more examples
                            of general home cleaning tasks, visit Out of Sight Residential Cleaning’s services page.
                        </div>
                        <div><h2>Curtain Cleaning:</h2> Curtain cleaning services can include both on and off-site cleaning
                            methods. The on-site process involves dry cleaning. It is generally recommended because it’s
                            more convenient for the client (curtains aren’t
                            taken down and rehung), gentler on the fabric, and provides a superior clean.</div>
                        <div><h2>Office Cleaning:</h2> This commercial cleaning service typically involves cleaning work areas,
                            common areas, cubicles, restrooms, kitchens, and reception areas. Tasks will include
                            mopping, dusting, polishing, sanitizing, and waste removal.
                            For more examples of cleaning tasks, visit the Maid Sailors Office Cleaning page.</div>
                        <div><h2>Restroom Cleaning:</h2> Cleaning restrooms may be part of office and home cleaning, but it’s
                            also a high demand standalone commercial service. Stadiums, schools, one-off events, and
                            open public spaces can all benefit from this service.</div>
                        <div><h2>Laundry Services:</h2> A superb add on to offer homeowners where you wash, dry, and fold clothes
                            while cleaning their house.</div>
                        <div><h2>Carpet Cleaning:</h2> Typical carpet cleaning services include steam cleaning, carpet repairs,
                            and stain and odor removal. Get our tips on starting a carpet cleaning business here.</div>
