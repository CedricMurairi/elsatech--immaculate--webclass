                        Many front loading machines have internal electrical heating elements to heat the wash water, to near boiling if desired. The rate of chemical cleaning action of the detergent and other laundry chemicals increases greatly with temperature, in accordance with the Arrhenius equation.

                        Dry cleaning businesses, from the perspective of the customer, are either plants or drop shops. A plant does on-site cleaning. A drop shop receives garments from customers, sends them to a large plant, and then has the cleaned garment returned to the shop for collection by the customer. The turnaround time is longer for a drop shop than for a local plant.

                    <p>
                        Steam cleaning involves using steam for cleaning. Its uses include domestic applications in cleaning flooring and household dirt removal, and industrial uses in removing grease and dirt from engines.

                        When used without soap, detergents, or other cleaning products, steam cleaning is an eco-friendly way of cleaning.
                        In ovens, steam cleaning is an alternative to self cleaning that uses lower temperatures.

                    <p>
                        Although there is an actual steam cleaning industrial process, in the context of carpet cleaning, "steam cleaning" is often mistaken for hot water soil extraction cleaning, which is professionally known as HWE. The hot water soil extraction cleaning method uses equipment that sprays heated water and detergent on the carpet and simultaneously, the water and detergent is extracted, along with any dislodged and dissolved dirt.
